# Cam2BEV: Camera to Bird Eye View
The aim of this project is to build a simple python package that can convert single/multi-cam images to a bird eye view representation using a neural network. This is especially useful in perception and planning tasks for autonomous/semi-autonomous vehicles or driving assistant systems. The network used for this purpose is the UNetXST from the [paper]().
